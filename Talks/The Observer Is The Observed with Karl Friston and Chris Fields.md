With [[Chris Fields]] and [[Karl Friston]]

On phenomenal consciousness:

Fields: The dividing line that I might like to propose is between systems that are capable of acting to get more information in the future, which Karl has characterized in his work as acting in pursuit of epistemic value. In ordinary language, one would characterize this as curiosity, acting with curiosity.

What is characteristic of the kind of systems that we tend to regard as having phenomenal consciousness of the sort that we have is that they act with curiosity fairly clearly. Other mammals, for example, are all curious.

Friston: Acting in a way to resolve your expected surprise, which is just uncertainty, that would be the definition of curiosity. You have to have a frame of reference, a structure on the inside that can predict the consequences of any particular action.

Certain systems have this capacity to not only resolve or minimize their surprise in the moment but also act upon a world in a way that they anticipate they will minimize their expected surprise and resolve uncertainty.

This is called the principle of optimal Bayesian experimental design. Namely, what is the best experiment, the best action, the best acting upon the world that will minimize our uncertainty (maximize our expected information gain) that we can compute? So, if we know the state of the world, and we know what we don't know, then we can estimate how much uncertainty we can resolve if we did that as opposed to this.

That's just what we do as scientistsâ€”we design our experiments exactly in the way that resolves the greatest amount of uncertainty about our competing hypotheses, as scored by maximizing the expected information gain.

Active Learning in Machine Learning.

Fields: Observer is, minimally, any system that interacts with the environment such that the joint observer-environment system's state is separable, so they are not entangled. Under those conditions, one can talk about the state of the observer and how the state of the observer changes as it receives information from the environment and as it acts on the environment.

So, an observer is something that can receive information and act in a conditionally independent way from its environment.

Friston: Anything that can be separated, or identified, individuated from its embedding environment must, by definition, have a Markov blanket. That Markov blanket must comprise some sensory states, so it must be its existence belies the fact that it is evidence that it is observing, that it is processing sensory information.

Fields: Levin's multi-scale competency architecture, which all organisms have. Each level of the hierarchy is competent to do things on its own without being told. It's that sense of hierarchy, where at each level, there are certain defined capabilities, that is at play in these kinds of hierarchical models.
