Geoffrey Hinton — Asked ChatGPT what a compost heap has in common with an atom bomb. GPT-4 started by saying that they are very different energy scales, so they look very different on the surface. But then it got into chain reactions and how their energy increases the rate at which they generate energy. So, it got the idea of a chain reaction.

Demis Hasabis — Three levels of creativity:

1. Interpolation — just averaging what you have seen to create a prototypical new thing, e.g., a new cat from all the cat images you have seen.
2. Extrapolation, e.g., move 37 with AlphaGo, new Go strategies, new music pieces, new poetry, etc.
3. Invention or out-of-the-box thinking. That would be equivalent to AlphaGo inventing Go or inventing chess.
