When we are in very complex spaces, the stepping stones that lead to things that are interesting to us do not resemble those things. Therefore, an algorithm that is focused only on achieving those things will fail to find them. We can find those things by being open-minded and open-ended, choosing things to pursue only because they are interesting, not because we know where they are going.

The novelty search algorithm: Let's not search for the solution to something. Let's not explicitly formalize what the goal is in the algorithm. Let's only try to produce novel behaviors.

Often, you won't be able to solve the problem intentionally. A novelty search will not solve it. Nothing will. The advantage of novelty search is not that it can solve a specific problem but that it will do something interesting, whereas trying to solve the problem will not do anything at all because it's deceptive.

This is true in very complex problems. In modest problems, objectives work perfectly fine, which is why we believe in them so much.
