As the legend goes, Offerus was a strong giant but with a dull mind.
His intentions were always good.
He wanted to serve the most powerful king on earth.
He was sent to the court of a mighty king to serve him.
One day, the king, hearing a singer say the devil's name, made a sign of the cross with terror.
Why do you make that sign?
Offerus asked.
Because I fear the devil, the king replied.
If you fear him, you are not as powerful as him, Offerus reasoned. I want to serve the devil.
And so he did and enrolled among Satan's servants.
One day, the servants met a cross by the side of the road and the devil ordered them to turn around.
Why is that?
The curious Offerus asked.
Because I fear the image of Christ, the devil replied.
If you fear him, you are not as powerful as him, Offerus reasoned.
I want to enter the service of Christ, Offerus exclaimed, and passed by the cross and went on his way.
On his way, Offerus met a hermit.
He asked the hermit where he could find Christ.
Everywhere, the hermit replied.
The hermit knew the type of dull giant he was dealing with and he knew he would not take to prayer.
So he led Offerus to a violent river and said, the poor people who have crossed this water have drowned.
Stay here and carry them on your strong shoulders.
If you do this, Christ will recognize you as his servant.
And so he did.
Offerus spent his days and nights carrying people across the river.
One night, overwhelmed with fatigue, Offerus received a knock on his door. \
It was a child who wanted to cross.
Offerus took him on his shoulders and began crossing the river.
But as he reached the middle, the river became a furious torrent.
The waves swelled and Offerus began to buckle.
In fear of letting the child fall, Offerus uprooted a tree to lean on.
But the child was becoming heavier and heavier.
Offerus began to fear the child would drown.
He lifted his head up and asked, child, why do you make yourself so heavy?
It seems to me that I carry the world.
The child replied, not only do you carry the world, you carry the one that made the world.
I am Christ.
As a reward, I baptize you in the name of the Father, in my own name and in the name of the Holy Spirit.
From now on you will be called Christopher.
Christopher walked the earth for the rest of his days to teach the word of Christ.
Christopher, the one who bears Christ for the masses.
