# [[Karma]]

Karma means intentional action.

Action occurs through the mind, speech, and body.

The intention, the key ingredient of karma, is of the mind.

Karma is of the mind.

Dark karma of the body:

- destroying life
- stealing
- sexual misconduct

Dark karma of speech:

- false speech
- divisive speech
- offensive speech
- pointless speech

Dark karma of the mind:

- craving
- aversion
- ignorance

So, the list of dark karma can be reduced to its three final members.

Buddhists call craving, aversion, and ignorance the three fires.

Craving and aversion are a form of desire. Desire is the active form of the delusion "I," the sense of being a separate, limited self. Desire is ignorance of our true nature.

# [[Rebirth]]

Rebirth is a misnomer. The word suggests someone is born, dies, and is then reborn. In other words, a self passes from one life to the next. The idea of a separate self is, according to the Buddha, our core delusion.

According to the Buddha, no self ever gets reborn (or born in the first place). Rather, karmic energy propagates through the world and forms in its tracks what we call selves or beings.

Waves: our language pictures the causal chain of events that give rise to the phenomenon of waves as an object. In reality, it is a process.

The world of experience is a combination of five aggregates: form, feeling, perception, mental formations, and consciousness. The five aggregates mix together to form the world of experience, just as the three colors of individual pixels mix together to form different colors. They form what we call our "self."

"Wave" is a conventional label for a pattern of excitation of water. This excitation is due to the transfer of energy.

The Buddha says that "self" is a conventional label for what is really a pattern of excitation of the five aggregates. This excitation is due to the transfer of karma.

Karmic energy passes through samsara and creates patterns of the five aggregates. These patterns are what we call animals, demons, gods, and people. All of samsara is pulsation of karma.

Our intentional actions are not without cause. The cause of karma is desire.

The delusion "I am" expressed as desire creates intentional actions. Intentional actions gather bundles of the five aggregates. These bundles of the five aggregates through the delusion "I am," driven by desire, create intentional actions. This loop is the prison of samsara, "the wandering."

> From an inconceivable beginning comes the wandering ... A beginning point is not discernible, though beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating and wandering on.
>
> [Gangā Sutta](https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/SN/SN15_8.html), SN 15:8

Rebirth is not the transition of an entity from any life to another. What we call a self or a being is what the transfer of karma looks like.

Our mind and sense faculties are literally our past karma.

> The eye \[ear, nose, tongue, skin, and min\] is to be regarded as old kamma, brought into existence and created by intention...

> Kamma Sutta, SN 35.145

> The action one performs now by body, speech, and mind. This monks, is called "new kamma."
>
> Kamma Sutta, SN 35.145

You find yourself in predetermined circumstances but it is up to you to choose how to respond to these circumstances.

Personal effort is indispensable to enlightenment.

Through the body, speech, and mind, you generate karma. This karma can be bright or dark in various degrees. It accumulates until the body fails, and the five aggregates fall apart, i.e., until you die. At the moment of death, the accumulated karma issues out like a lightning bolt and strikes samsara in the new place. There, it animates a new bundle of the five aggregates. This bundle is determined by causes and conditions, the main one being the accumulated karma. Ultimately, there is no rebirth. There is only karma pulsating through samsara, creating patterns like waves on the lake. We are these patterns.

# Conventional vs. Ultimate Truth

Low-resolution truth (conventional) vs. high-resolution truth.

Conventionally, we are waves. Ultimately, there's energy transfer.

# Bhavanga-sota

In Pāli, "ground of being" or "condition for existence."

> The term bhavanga-sota, is identical with what the modern psychologists, such as Jung, etc., call the soul, or the unconscious, thereby not meaning, of course, the eternal soul-entity in the Christian teaching but an ever-changing subconscious process.
>
> This subconscious life-stream is the necessary condition of all life. In it, all impressions and experiences are stored up, or better said, appear as multiple processes of past images, or memory pictures, which, however, as such, are hidden to full consciousness but which, especially in dreams, cross the threshold of consciousness and make themselves fully conscious.
>
> — [[Nyanatiloka Mahathera]], _[[Fundamentals of Buddhism]]_

This is a strong parallel with Jung's idea of the collective unconscious.

# How Does Karma Stay in Its Lane?

The bundle of five aggregates we take to be our "selves" stick together because of a strong causal relationship between them. This causal relationship is also what keeps certain karma associated with a certain bundle of aggregates.

# Liberation

You can create as much bright karma as you can and hope for a good rebirth. You may even earn the rank of a deity if you really put your back into it. But Buddha says it's a bad deal.

Buddha says that among all planes of existence, human rebirth is the most precious one. In lower planes, suffering, impermanence, and lack of a stable identity are so extreme that spiritual practice is impossible.

In planes above the human, life is blissful and long-lasting, but it is too blissful and too long-lasting. One has no need for spiritual practice then, or so one thinks.

Human existence is the middle way between suffering and bliss, permanence and impermanence, self and no self. It provides the best conditions for working out one's own salvation.

We shouldn't waste the opportunity we were given.

To accumulate bright karma is still a waste in the eyes of the Buddha.

Karma chains us to impermanence, dissatisfaction, and emptiness of any real substance. Samsara is a prison. Accumulating bright karma is a way of getting a transfer to a more comfortable cell.

What's the alternative?

Karma that leads to the end of karma.

> Right View, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.
>
> This is called kamma that is neither dark nor bright with neither dark nor bright result, leading to the end of kamma.
>
> [Ariyamagga Sutta](https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/AN/AN4_237.html), AN 4 235

This is the Noble Eightfold Path leading out of samsara.

Intentional action drives existence. One cannot avoid action. The avoidance of action itself is an action. It is not in our power not to act, but we can choose how to act. So, one must limit oneself to a set of intentional actions that gradually lead to one's own cessation.

What is intention?

Craving and aversion are two sides of the delusion of a separate self. All intention comes from here. Even the brightest karma springs from craving, aversion, or ignorance.

The Noble Eightfold Path is meant to transform consciousness so that the three fires of craving, aversion, and delusion are blown out. This is called "nirvana," literally meaning "blown out," or "extinguished."

To put out the fires, you have to use the fires.

The Eightfold Path is the practice of craving the right things, being averse to the right things, and being ignorant in the right way.

In the closed loop of samsara, there is a closed loop that leads to the end of all closed loops. A path leading to the end of all paths. The end of wandering. The end of samsara.

Once the self-delusion is extinguished, there can be no more craving, no more aversion, no more intention. Without intention, there can be no more karma. After reaching this point, what previously was a person becomes pure enlightened action. The five aggregates remain together, bound by previous karma, but when the body dies, no new birth follows.

What appears as an enlightened person from the outside is really the flow of the dhamma into samsara.

No self ever dissolves. Rather, the delusion of a self dissolves and reveals the unconditioned reality of nirvana, which has always been right here, at the very heart of samsara.

Enlightenment is when the emptiness wakes up from the dream that is you.

# Emptiness of Views

Holding no views, even Buddhist ones. Even Buddhist views are chains of gold.

The Buddha did not insist that people believe in karma and rebirth. He said that to live as if these doctrines were true is better than to live as if they were not.

What we do, say, and think is what we are.
