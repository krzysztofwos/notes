# The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha - A Translation of the Majjhima Nikāya

> When this was said, the venerable Sariputta asked the Blessed One, "Venerable Sir, which of us has spoken well?"
> Buddha: "You have all spoken well, Sariputta, each in his own way. Hear also from me what kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sala-tree Wood Here, Sariputta, when a bhikkhu has returned from his arms round, after his meal he sits down, folds his legs crosswise, sets his body erect, and establishing mindfulness in front of him resolves, 'I shall not break this sitting position until through not clinging my mind is liberated from the taints.' That kind of bhikkhu could illuminate this Gosinga Sala-tree Wood."
>
> — 32. [[Mahagosinga Sutta]]: The Greater Discourse in Gosinga, 12:28:37

> Right view. Friend, how many conditions are there for the arising of right view?
> Friend, there are two conditions for the arising of right view, the voice of another and wise attention. These are the two conditions for the arising of right view.
>
> — 43. [[Mahavedalla Sutta]]: The Greater Series of Questions and Answers, 15:46:21

> Summary. This discourse is a discussion on various subtle points of Dhamma between the bhikkhuni Dhammadina and the lay follower Visakha.
> ...
> Lady, how many kinds of feeling are there?
> Friend Visakha, there are three kinds of feeling, pleasant feeling, painful feeling, and neither painful nor pleasant feeling.
> But lady, what is pleasant feeling? What is painful feeling? What is neither painful nor pleasant feeling?
> Friend Visakha, whatever is felt bodily or mentally as pleasant and soothing is pleasant feeling. Whatever is felt bodily or mentally as painful and hurting is painful feeling. Whatever is felt bodily or mentally as neither soothing nor hurting is neither painful nor pleasant feeling.
> Lady, what is pleasant and what is painful in regard to pleasant feeling? What is painful and what is pleasant in regard to painful feeling? What is pleasant and what is painful in regard to neither painful nor pleasant feeling?
> Friend Visakha, pleasant feeling is pleasant when it persists and painful when it changes. Painful feeling is painful when it persists and pleasant when it changes. Neither painful nor pleasant feeling is pleasant when there is knowledge of it and painful when there is no knowledge of it.

# The Mind Illuminated by Culadasa

## Chapter 3

> The untrained mind produces distractions that lead to forgetting, which results in mind wandering.
>
> — Audiobook, 00:54:25

> In reality, all we're doing in meditation is forming and holding specific conscious intention, nothing more.
> In fact, while it may not be obvious, all our achievements originate from intentions.
> Consider learning to play catch. As a child, you may have wanted to play catch, but at first your arm and hand just didn't move in quite the right way.
> However, by sustaining the intention to catch the ball after much practice, your arm and hand eventually performed the task whenever you wanted.
> You don't play catch. Instead, you just intend to catch the ball, and the rest follows. You intend, and the body acts.
> In exactly the same way, we can use intention to profoundly transform how the mind behaves.
> Intention, provided it is correctly formulated and sustained, is what creates the causes and conditions for stable attention and mindfulness.
> Intentions repeatedly sustained over the course of many meditation sessions give rise to frequently repeated mental acts, which eventually become habits of the mind.
> At every stage, all you really do is patiently and persistently hold your intentions to respond in specific ways to whatever happens during your meditation.
> Setting and holding the right intentions is what's essential. If your intention is strong, the appropriate responses will occur, and the practice will unfold in a very natural and predictable way.
> Once again, repeatedly sustained intentions lead to repeated mental actions, which become mental habits, the habits of mind that lead to joy, equanimity, and insight.
>
> — Audiobook, 01:10:49

## Chatper 4

> Stable attention is the ability to intentionally direct and sustain the focus of attention, as well as to control the scope of attention.
> Intentionally directing and sustaining attention simply means that we learn to choose which object we are going to attend to and keep our attention continuously fixed on it.
> Controlling the scope of attention means training the mind to adjust how wide or narrow our focus is and being more selective and intentional about what is included and excluded.
>
> — Audiobook, 01:26:19

> Just by intending to observe an object and to come back whenever we get distracted, we're training that unconscious process to help us stay focused more continuously.
>
> — Audiobook, 01:32:29

> Attention analyzes our experience, and peripheral awareness provides the context.
>
> — Audiobook, 01:41:58

## Chapter 5

> Put all your effort into forming and holding a conscious intention to sit down and meditate for a set period every day, and to practice diligently for the duration of the set.
> When your intentions are clear and strong, the appropriate actions naturally follow, and you'll find yourself regularly sitting down to meditate.
>
> — Audiobook, 02:03:47

> Both moral principles and ethical codes can be followed blindly, without necessarily having to resolve your own bad mental habits.
> Rather, virtue is the practice of inner purification, which results in good behavior.
> If you think of the mind as an engine, the practice of virtue allows for the smoothest, most powerful performance.
>
> — Audiobook, 03:18:04

## The Moments of Consciousness Model

- This model is drawn from the Theravada Buddhist Abhidhamma and includes some elaborations and expansions by a later Buddhist school known as the Yogachara.
- The mind is a stream of consciousness, a series of discrete moments of experience.
- Audiobook, 05:59:27.

**Seven Different Types of Moments of Consciousness:**

> In all, there are seven kinds of moments. The first five are obvious, since they correspond to the physical senses, sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch.
> The sixth category, maybe less obvious, is called the mind sense, meaning it includes mental objects like thoughts and emotions.
> Finally, there is a seventh type of consciousness, called binding consciousness, that integrates the information provided by the other senses.
> — Audiobook, 06:03:16

1. sight
2. sound
3. smell
4. taste
5. somatic sensation (touch)
6. mind sense
7. binding consciousness

> Therefore, the seven different kinds of moments of consciousness are sight, sound, smell, taste, somatosensory, and mental, plus the binding moment.
>
> — Audiobook, 06:08:42

> Conscious intention.
> We intend to observe the meditation object.
> We intend to direct attention away from distractions and return to the meditation object.
> We intend to sustain attention on it.
> We intend to engage fully with its details. |
> Intention plays an important role in each moment of consciousness.
> It determines the objects of subsequent moments of consciousness.
> The stronger our intention to attend to a particular object, the more moments of attention will subsequently be focused on that object.
>
> — Audiobook, 06:19:59

> Projected onto it are the contents of moments of consciousness from the six categories of sensory experience, visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, somatosensory, and mental, and binding moments of consciousness.
>
> — Audiobook, 07:08:17

**Six Categories of Sensory Experience:**

1. visual
2. auditory
3. olfactory
4. gustatory
5. somatosensory
6. mental

**Seven Different Types of Moments of Consciousness:**

1. visual
2. auditory
3. olfactory
4. gustatory
5. somatosensory
6. mental
7. binding

> We can think of the conscious mind as a screen.
> Projected onto it are the contents of moments of consciousness from the six categories of sensory experience, visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, somatosensory, and mental, and binding moments of consciousness.
> The conscious mind can be described entirely in terms of these seven types of moments of consciousness.
> In other words, consciousness is visual experience, auditory experience, etc.
> Our experience of these moments of consciousness is passive, yet recall from the moments of consciousness model that every moment also has an active component, intention.
> The intention in a moment of consciousness may be subliminal, remaining in the background, or may itself become an object of attention.
> These conscious intentions can be precursors to mental, verbal, or physical actions.
> For example, say that a moment of somatosensory consciousness arises with an unpleasant skin sensation as its object.
> The accompanying intention might be a spontaneous urge to scratch an itch.

## Snippets

### Moments of Consciousness Model

> According to this model, consciousness is a series of discrete events rather than continuous, because we can only be conscious of information coming from one sense organ at a time.
> Moments of seeing are distinct from moments of hearing, moments of smelling from moments of touch, and so on.
> Therefore, each is a separate mental event with its own unique content.
> Moments of visual experience can be interspersed with moments of auditory, tactile, mental, and other sensory experience, but no two can happen at the same time.
> For example, a moment of visual consciousness must end before you can have a thought, a moment of mental consciousness about what you've just seen.
> It is only because these different moments replace each other so quickly that seeing, hearing, thinking, and so forth all seem to happen at the same time.
> The moments of consciousness model posits that, within each of these moments, nothing changes. They are truly like freeze frames.
> Even our experience of watching something move is the result of many separate moments of visual consciousness, one rapidly following the next.
> Therefore, all conscious experience, without exception, consists of individual, brief moments, each containing a single, static chunk of information.
> In that sense, we can say that each mind moment provides only a single object of consciousness.
> Because moments of consciousness coming from different sense organs contain such different information, consciousness is less like a film in which every frame is similar to the last, and more like a string of differently colored beads.
> While this model is quite different from how we usually think about consciousness, it's not just a nice theory someone thought up.
> The basic premise of distinct moments of consciousness arising and passing away in sequence is based on the actual meditation experiences of advanced practitioners from across a broad range of traditions.
> It's an experience that the composers of the Abhidhamma who formulated this model either had firsthand or learned about from other advanced meditators.
> It's also an experience you yourself will have in the later stages.
> Yet long before you do, this model will help you, just as it has helped other practitioners for over two millennia.
>
> — Audiobook, 06:00:23

### Shamatha and Vipassana

> Tibetan practices emphasize elaborate visualizations or sophisticated analytical meditations, whereas Zen strips meditation down to the bare bones, giving you minimal instructions like, just sit.
> Some Theravada teachers emphasize rigorously cultivating mindfulness to the exclusion of stable, focused attention, while others insist that intense concentration leading to deep, meditative absorption is best.
> Rather than argue for any specific technique, this book will help you make sense of all these different approaches without having to reject any of them.
> But to do this, I first need to clarify an important set of terms commonly found in meditation literature, showing how they relate to each other and the goal of awakening.
> These terms are shamatha, tranquility or calm abiding, vipassana, insight, samadhi, concentration or stable attention, and sati, mindfulness.
> Awakening from our habitual way of perceiving things requires a profound shift in our intuitive understanding of the nature of reality.
> Awakening is a cognitive event, the culminating insight in a series of very special insights called vipassana.
> This climax of the progress of insight only occurs when the mind is in a unique mental state called shamatha.
> Shamatha and vipassana are both generated using stable attention, samadhi, and mindfulness, sati.
> Although it's possible to cultivate either shamatha or vipassana independently of one another, both are necessary for awakening.
> Shamatha has five characteristics, effortlessly stable attention, samadhi, powerful mindfulness, sati, joy, tranquility and equanimity.
> The complete state of shamatha results from working with stable attention and mindfulness until joy emerges.
> Joy then gradually matures into tranquility and equanimity arises out of that tranquility.
> A mind in shamatha is the ideal instrument for achieving insight.
> Vipassana refers specifically to insight into the true nature of reality that radically transforms our understanding of ourselves and our relationship to the world.
> However, meditation also produces many other very useful, mundane insights, such as a better understanding of our own personality, social interactions, human behavior in general, and how the everyday world works.
> It can give us flashes of creative brilliance or intellectual epiphanies that solve problems or help us make new discoveries.
> These useful insights are not vipassana, however, because they neither transform us personally nor our understanding of reality in any profound way.
> The insights called vipassana are not intellectual. Rather, they are experientially based, deeply intuitive realizations that transcend and ultimately shatter our commonly held beliefs and understandings.
> The five most important of these are insights into impermanence, emptiness, the nature of suffering, the causal interdependence of all phenomena, and the illusion of the separate self, that is, no self.
> You can experience the first four of these insights using stable attention, samadhi, and mindfulness, sati, to investigate phenomena, dhammavitya, with persistence and energy, virya.
> The fifth insight into no self is the culminating insight that actually produces awakening, because only by overcoming our false, self-centered worldview can we realize our true nature.
> But this crucial insight requires, in addition to the first four insights, that the mind also be in a state of shamatha, filled with deep tranquility and equanimity.
> For both shamatha and vipassana, you need stable attention, samadhi, and mindfulness, sati.
>
> — Audiobook, 00:32:42

### On Intentions

> As you continue to meditate, this fact of no self becomes increasingly clear, but you can't afford to wait for that inside.
> For the sake of making progress, it's best to drop this notion, at least at an intellectual level, as soon as possible.
> In reality, all we're doing in meditation is forming and holding specific conscious intention, nothing more.
> In fact, while it may not be obvious, all our achievements originate from intentions.
> Consider learning to play catch. As a child, you may have wanted to play catch, but at first your arm and hand just didn't move in quite the right way.
> However, by sustaining the intention to catch the ball after much practice, your arm and hand eventually performed the task whenever you wanted.
> You don't play catch. Instead, you just intend to catch the ball, and the rest follows. You intend, and the body acts.
> In exactly the same way, we can use intention to profoundly transform how the mind behaves.
> Intention, provided it is correctly formulated and sustained, is what creates the causes and conditions for stable attention and mindfulness.
> Intentions repeatedly sustained over the course of many meditation sessions give rise to frequently repeated mental acts, which eventually become habits of the mind.
> At every stage, all you really do is patiently and persistently hold your intentions to respond in specific ways to whatever happens during your meditation.
> Setting and holding the right intentions is what's essential. If your intention is strong, the appropriate responses will occur, and the practice will unfold in a very natural and predictable way.
> Once again, repeatedly sustained intentions lead to repeated mental actions, which become mental habits, the habits of mind that lead to joy, equanimity, and insight.

## Noting

The practice is this: make a quiet, mental one-word note of whatever you experience in each moment. Try to stay with the sensations of breathing, which may occur in many places, noting these quickly as "rising" (as many times as the sensations of the breath rising are experienced) and then "falling" in the same way. These are the fundamental insight practice instructions. When the mind wanders, notes might include "thinking", "feeling", "pressure", "tension", "wandering", "anticipating", "seeing", "hearing", "cold", "hot", "pain", "pleasure", etc.

Practical Insight Meditation by Mahasi Sayadaw

Manual of Insight by Mahasi Sayadaw

## Snippets

There are two major aspects to the Buddha’s teaching on dukkha, the first and most famous being the implications of having been born, which entails issues of having a body, and the ordinary facts of physical pain, sickness, aging, and death, as well as interpersonal conflicts, personal losses, fears, sorrows, grief, lamentation, and the like. These unfortunate aspects of having been born are clearly of great significance throughout our brief lives. However, the second aspect of dukkha is the key for insight practices, and that is the inherent painful tension that comes because we take the sensate data coming in and misinterpret those sensations in a way that causes us to habitually create the illusion of a permanent, separate, independently functioning (acausal), localized self. This mode of perceiving experience is more painful than the other way that sensate reality can be perceived, in which sensate data imply the exact reverse: that there is naturally occurring, causal, self-perceiving, immediate transience. Insight practices can show us this other, less painful way of perceiving reality, and eventually hardwire it into our systems so that we don’t go back to the more painful way which involves the dukkha created by this misperception. — Chapter 5, p. 29

More formally, and following the classification found in the Abhidhamma, we find ten or fourteen kilesas emphasized as being the most dangerous for us, with a more complete list being: greed, wrong view, delusion, hatred, doubt, conceit, restlessness, sloth, worry, torpor, shamelessness, fearlessness (of wrongdoing), envy, and avarice. — Chapter 5, p. 31

Thus, most teachers won’t say something as straightforward as, "Well, when I was meditating, I spent some time lost in the stories and tape-loops of my mind. This was terrible and I got nowhere but nutty. However, one day a senior teacher straightened me out and convinced me to ground my mind in the specific sensations that make up the objects of meditation and examine impermanence. After some days of consistent and diligent practice using correct technique, I began to directly penetrate the three illusions of permanence, satisfactoriness, and self, and my world began to be broken down into the mind-moments and vibrations that I always thought were just talk. By paying careful attention to bare phenomena arising and passing moment after quick moment, I progressively moved through the stages of insight and got my first taste of awakening. Thus, if you spin in content and don’t realize the three characteristics, you are wasting your time and mine. This is just the way it is. If you develop strong concentration on the primary object and investigate the three characteristics consistently, this will almost certainly produce insight. This is just the way it is. Any questions?" — Chapter 20, p. 115

As mentioned before, concentration can produce great stability and consistency of mind, and this can lead to equanimity, which is that quality of mind that is okay with things; or balanced in the face of any internal or external painful, pleasurable, or neutral condition, including a lack of equanimity. This may sound a bit strange, but it is well worth considering. Equanimity also relates to a lack of struggle even when struggling, to effortlessness even in effort, to peacefulness even when there is no tranquility. When equanimity is well developed, we are not frightened of being afraid, concerned by being worried, irritated by being annoyed, pissed off by being angry, etc. — Chapter 7, The Seven Factors of Awakening, p. 53

## 48 [[Kosambiya Sutta]]

**The Seven Factors of Stream-Entry:**

1. Knowing the mind is free of obsessions and thus well-disposed for seeing things as they really are and awakening to the truths.
2. Knowing that with this view one’s mind attains serenity.
3. Knowing that one’s view is consistent with the Buddha’s dispensation, not that of other teachers.
4. Knowing oneself to have that character that would lead a person to immediately confess any violation of monastic rules and practice restraint in the future.
5. Knowing oneself to have that character that would remain dedicated to training in virtue, meditation and wisdom even if he or she is active in monastic affairs.
6. Knowing oneself to have the strength to give careful attention when listening to the Buddha teaching the Dharma and Discipline.
7. Knowing oneself to have the strength of someone who is inspired and gladdened in hearing the Buddha teaching the Dhamma and Discipline.
