# Transcend and include

[SEEKER TO SEEKER â€” Existence Has A Purpose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avLf90XDh0A)

Ken Wilber defines evolution as a process of "transcend and include."

Transcend meaning each evolutionary stage possesses features that cannot be found in previous stages.

Include meaning each stage arises from and is dependent on all previous stages.

In this way, atoms are transcended and included in molecules. Molecules are transcended and included in cells. Cells are transcended and included in organisms, and so on.
