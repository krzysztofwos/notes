> The big events in Jesus' life were marked with reference to the moon, while everyday life was ruled by the sun. The two calendars drifted with respect to each other, making it very difficult to predict when a holiday was due. Easter was just such a drifting holiday. So every few generations a monk was drafted to calculate the dates when Easter would fall for the next few hundred years. Dionysius Exiguus was one of these monks. In the sixth century, the pope, John I, asked him to extend the Easter tables. While translating and recalculating the tables, Dionysius did a little research on the side. He realized that he could figure out just when Jesus Christ was born. After chugging through a bit of math, he decided that the current year was the 525th year since the birth of Christ. Dionysius decided that the year of Christ's birth should, henceforth, be the year 1 anno Domini, or the first year of our Lord. Technically, Dionysius said that Christ's birth happened on December 25th, the year before, and he started his calendar on January 1st to match the Roman year. The next year after that was 2 AD and the next 3 AD and so forth, replacing the two dating systems then most commonly in use. But there was a problem. Make that two. For one thing, Dionysius got the date of Christ's birth wrong. The sources agree that Mary and Joseph fled the wrath of King Herod since Herod had heard a prophecy about a newborn Messiah. But Herod died in 3 BC, years before the supposed birth of Christ. Dionysius was clearly wrong. Today, most scholars believe that the birth of Christ was in 4 BC.

> Before the fifteenth century, paintings and drawings were largely flat and lifeless. \
> The images in them were distorted and two-dimensional. \
> Gigantic flat knights peered out of tiny, misshapen castles. \
> Even the best artists could not draw a realistic scene. \
> They did not know how to use the power of Zero. \
> It was an Italian architect, Filippo Brunelleschi, who first demonstrated the power of an infinite Zero. \
> He created a realistic painting by using a vanishing point. \
> By definition, a point is a Zero, thanks to the concept of dimension. \
> In everyday life you deal with three-dimensional objects. \
> The Einstein revealed that our world is four-dimensional, as we shall hear in a later chapter. \
> The clock on your dresser, the cup of coffee you drink in the morning, the book you're listening to right now, all these are three-dimensional objects. \
> Now imagine that a gigantic hand comes down and squashes the book flat. \
> Instead of being a three-dimensional object, the book is now a flat, floppy rectangle. \
> It has lost a dimension, it has length and width, but no height. \
> It is now two-dimensional. \
> Now imagine that the book turned sideways is crushed once again by the giant hand. \
> The book is no longer a rectangle, it is a line. \
> Again, it has lost a dimension. \
> It has neither height nor width, but it has length. \
> It is a one-dimensional object. \
> You can take away even this single dimension, squashed along its length, the line becomes a point, an infinitesimal nothing with no length, no width, and no height. \
> A point is a zero-dimensional object. \
> In 1425 Brunelleschi placed just such a point in the center of a drawing of a famous Florentine building, the Baptistery. \
> This zero-dimensional object, the vanishing point, is an infinitesimal dot on the canvas that represents a spot infinitely far away from the viewer. \
> As objects recede into the distance in the painting, they get closer and closer to the vanishing point, getting more compressed as they get farther away from the viewer. \
> Everything sufficiently distant, people, trees, buildings, is squashed into a zero-dimensional point and disappears.
> The zero in the center of the painting contains an infinity of space. \
> This apparently contradictory object turned Brunelleschi's drawing, almost magically, into such a good likeness of the three-dimensional Baptistery building that it was indistinguishable from the real thing. \
> Indeed, when Brunelleschi used a mirror to compare the painting and the building, the reflected image matched the building's geometry exactly. \
> The vanishing point turned a two-dimensional drawing into a perfect simulation of a three-dimensional building. \
> It is no coincidence that zero and infinity are linked in the vanishing point. \
> Just as multiplying by zero causes the number line to collapse into a point, the vanishing point has caused most of the universe to sit in a tiny dot. \
> This is a singularity, a concept that became very important later in the history of science, and at this early stage mathematicians knew little more than the artists about the properties of zero.
