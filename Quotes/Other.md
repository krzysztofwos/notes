> By reason of this deviation of the Sun from the center of gravity the centripetal force does not always tend to that immobile center, and hence the planets neither move exactly in ellipses nor revolve twice in the same orbit. Each time a planet revolves it traces a fresh orbit, as happens also with the motion of the Moon, and each orbit depends upon the combined motions of all the planets, not to mention their actions upon each other. Unless I am much mistaken, it would exceed the force of human wit to consider so many causes of motion at the same time, and to define the motions by exact laws which would allow of an easy calculation.

> The main difference between machine learning and statistics is what I'd call "β-hat versus y-hat." (I've also heard it described as inference versus prediction.) Academia cares a lot about what the estimated parameters look like (β-hat), and machine learning cares more about being able to estimate a dependent variable given some inputs (y-hat).

> Things are gonna be hard for a while, but you’ll come out. ‘Cause you got him in you. His fight is in you. Sometimes, a thing happens, splits your life. There’s a before and after. I got like five of them at this point. And this is your first. But if you use it right, the bad thing, you use it right, and it makes you better. Stronger. It gives you something most people don’t have. Bad as it is, wrong as it is... this hurt... it can make you a better man. That’s what pain does. It shows you what was on the inside. And inside you is pure gold. And I know that. Your father knew that, too. Pure, solid gold. That’s what you got.

The Revelation of [[Sonmi 451]]

> I understand now that boundaries between noise and sound are conventions. All boundaries are conventions, waiting to be transcended. One may transcend any convention if only one can first conceive of doing so. To be is to be perceived, and so to know thyself is only possible through the eyes of the other. The nature of our immortal lives is in the consequences of our words and deeds, that go on and are pushing themselves throughout all time. Our lives are not our own. From womb to tomb, we are bound to others, past and present, and by each crime and every kindness, we birth our future.
