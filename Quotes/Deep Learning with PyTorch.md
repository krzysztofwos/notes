> Building models that allow us to explain input/output relationships dates back centuries at least. When Johannes Kepler, a German mathematical astronomer (1571–1630), figured out his three laws of planetary motion in the early 1600s, he based them on data collected by his mentor Tycho Brahe during naked-eye observations (yep, seen with the naked eye and written on a piece of paper). Not having Newton’s law of gravitation at his disposal (actually, Newton used Kepler’s work to figure things out), Kepler extrapolated the simplest possible geometric model that could fit the data.

> 1. Got lots of good data from his friend Brahe (not without some struggle)
> 2. Tried to visualize the heck out of it, because he felt there was something fishy going on
> 3. Chose the simplest possible model that had a chance to fit the data (an ellipse)
> 4. Split the data so that he could work on part of it and keep an independent set for validation
> 5. Started with a tentative eccentricity and size for the ellipse and iterated until the model fit the observations
> 6. Validated his model on the independent observations
> 7. Looked back in disbelief
