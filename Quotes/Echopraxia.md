> We climbed this hill. Each step up, we could see farther. So of course we kept going. Now we're at the top. Science has been at the top for a few centuries now. And we look out, across the plain, and we see this other tribe dancing around, above the clouds, even higher than we are. Maybe it's a mirage. Maybe it's a trick. Or maybe they just climbed a higher peak we can't see because the clouds are blocking the view. So we head off to find out. But every step takes us downhill. No matter what direction we head, we can't move off our peak without losing our vantage point. So we climb back up again. We're trapped on a local maximum. But what if there is a higher peak out there, way across the plain? The only way to get there is bite the bullet, come down off our foothill, and trudge along the riverbed until we finally start going uphill again. And it's only then you realize, hey, this mountain reaches way higher than that foothill we were on before. And we can see so much better from up here. But you can't get there unless you leave behind all the tools that made you so successful in the first place. You have to take that first step downhill. — Dr. Liana Lutteroth, Faith and the Fitness Landscape, In Conversation, 2091.

> Ultimately, all science is correlation. No matter how effectively it may use one variable to describe another, its equations will always ultimately rest upon the surface of a black box. St. Herbert might have put it most succinctly when he observed that all proofs inevitably reduce to propositions that have no proof. The difference between science and faith, therefore, is no more and no less than predictive power.

> The bicameral order represents a stark anomaly in this otherwise consistent landscape. Their explicitly faith-based methodologies venture unapologetically into metaphysical realms that defy empirical analysis. Yet they yield results with consistently more predictive power than conventional science.

> How they do this is not known. Our best evidence suggests some kind of rewiring of the temporal lobe in a way that amplifies their connection to the divine. It would be dangerously naive to regard this as a victory for traditional religion. It is not. It is a victory for a radical sect barely half a century old, and the cost of that victory has been to demolish the wall between science and faith.

> The church's concession of the physical realm informed the historic armistice that has allowed faith and reason to coexist to this day. One may find it heartening to see faith ascendant once again across the human spectrum, but it is not our faith. Its hand still guides lost sheep away from the soulless empiricism of secular science. But the days in which it guided them into the loving arms of our Savior are waning. — An Enemy Within, the Bicameral Threat to Institutional Religion in the 21st Century, an internal report to the Holy See by the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, 2093.
