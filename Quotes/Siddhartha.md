> I have found a thought, Govinda, that you will again take as a joke or as folly, but it is my best thought. This is it. The opposite of every truth is just as true. You see, a truth can be uttered and clad in words only if it is one-sided. One-sided is everything that can be thought with thoughts and said in words. Everything one-sided, everything half, everything is devoid of wholeness, of roundness, of oneness. When the sublime Gautama spoke and taught about the world, he had to divide it into samsara and nirvana, into illusion and truth, into sorrow and salvation. There is no other choice, there is no other way for the man who wishes to teach. But the world itself, the being around us and within us, is never one-sided. Never is a man or a deed all samsara or all nirvana, never is a man all saintly or all sinful. It seems otherwise because we are prey to the illusion that time is a reality. But time is not real, Govinda. I have experienced this time and time again. And if time is not real, then the span that seems to lie between world and eternity, between sorrow and bliss, between evil and good, is also an illusion.
