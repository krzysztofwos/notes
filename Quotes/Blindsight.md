> So, a synthesist. Explaining the incomprehensible to the indifferent.

> Perfection's unattainable, but it isn't unapproachable, you know?

> Imagine you are a synthesist. You deal in the behavior of systems at their surfaces and further machinery beneath from its reflections above. That is the secret of your success. You understand the system by understanding the boundaries that contain it. Now imagine you encounter someone who has ripped a hole in those boundaries and bled beyond them.

> Bad eyes are only one bane of clear vision. Bad assumptions can be just as blinding.

> Brains are survival engines, not truth detectors. If self-deception promotes fitness, the brain lies, stops noticing irrelevant things. Truth never matters, only fitness. By now you don't experience the world as it exists at all. You experience a simulation built from assumptions, shortcuts, lies. Whole species is agnosiac by default.

> You know they can hold both aspects of a Necker cube in their heads at the same time? The term rang a bell. I subtitled and saw the thumbnail of a familiar wireframe box. Now I remembered, classical ambiguous illustration. Sometimes the shaded panel seemed to be in front, sometimes behind. The perspective flipped back and forth as you watched. You or I, we can only see it one way or the other, Pag said. Vamps see it both ways at once. Do you have any idea what kind of an edge that gives them?

> Do you want to know what consciousness is for? Do you want to know the only real purpose it serves? Training wheels. You can't see both aspects of the Necker cube at once, so it lets you focus on one and dismiss the other. That's a pretty half-assed way to parse reality. You're always better off looking at more than one side of anything. Go on. Try. Defocus.
