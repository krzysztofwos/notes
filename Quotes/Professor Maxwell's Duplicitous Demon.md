> The Lagrangian consists of a set of equations based on differential calculus that link the velocity, momentum and kinetic energy of a body. Although the route to developing the Lagrangian involved thinking about actual physical processes, once the function is established and found to match what is observed, it can be considered totally detached from any analogy.
>
> Rather than relying on a mechanical model, this kind of function is a purely mathematical model. It is a black box where the user provides certain inputs, turns the handle and gets the outputs. If what comes out matches observation, the function can be used without any idea of how the system it is modelling actually works.

> In the mathematical belfry, Maxwell, the regular churchgoer, felt that the ideal analogy for a Lagrangian approach—he might have dismissed mechanical models, but he still loved using them to explain things—was a belfry.
>
> It's quite a lengthy quote, but it's worth taking it slowly and absorbing it, because with this simple illustration, Maxwell is showing how he brought modern physics into being.
>
> We may regard this investigation as a mathematical illustration of the scientific principle that in the study of any complex object, we must fix our attention on those elements of it which we are able to observe and to cause to vary, and ignore those which we can neither observe nor cause to vary. In other words, as Kant might say, stick to phenomena and forget noumena. In an ordinary belfry, each bell has one rope which comes down through a hole in the floor to the bell-ringer's room.

> But suppose that each rope, instead of acting on one bell, contributes to the motion of many pieces of machinery, and that the motion of each piece is determined not by the motion of one rope alone, but by that of several. And suppose, further, that all this machinery is silent and utterly unknown to the men on the ropes, who can only see as far as the holes in the floor above them.
>
> Supposing all this, what is the scientific duty of the men below? They have full command of the ropes, but of nothing else. They can give each rope any position and any velocity, and they can estimate its momentum by stopping all the ropes at once and feeling what sort of tug each rope gives. If they take the trouble to ascertain how much work they have to do in order to drag the ropes down to a given set of positions and to express this in terms of these positions, they have found the potential energy of the system in terms of the known coordinates.
>
> If they then find the tug on any one rope arising from a velocity equal to unity communicated to itself or to any other rope, they can express the kinetic energy in terms of the coordinates and velocities.
>
> Footnote. What Maxwell means in this rather clumsy wording is that by defining the velocity of this particular rope as one, they can establish a standard to measure the relative velocities of the other ropes.
>
> These data are sufficient to determine the motion of every one of the ropes when it and all the others are acted on by any given forces. This is all that the men at the ropes can ever know. If the machinery above has more degrees of freedom than there are ropes, the coordinates which express these degrees of freedom must be ignored. There is no help for it.

> In the 1850s, the mathematics needed to handle vectors was yet to be fully developed, but Maxwell was aware of the basics and of some of the requirements to analyse a field mathematically. He asked for help from fellow Scot William Thomson, who'd already done some work on electricity using vectors, basing it on his better-developed study of the flow of heat. Thomson had discovered that by some strange natural coincidence, the equations describing the strength and direction of the electrostatic force between electrical charges were the same as those that dealt with the rate of flow and direction of flow of heat. Maxwell took Thomson's guidance on the mathematics of vectors, but went his own way on applying it. He thought of electricity as behaving like a fluid that was flowing through a porous substance, while magnetism seemed like vortices within the fluid. The lines of flow of his fluid corresponded to Faraday's lines of force, and the speed of the flow provided the flux density, which was a measure of the strength of the electrical or magnetic field. The difference in porousness of the materials that the imaginary fluid flowed through corresponded to the way that different substances reacted to electrical and magnetic fields.

> The power of analogy.
>
> For Maxwell, this novel use of analogy — building models — was the way forward to better understand the physical principles of the natural world. While still a student at Cambridge, he had written: "Whenever [men] see a relation between two things they know well, and think they see there must be a similar relation between things less known, they reason from one to the other. This supposes that, although pairs of things may differ widely from each other, the relation in the one pair may be the same as that in the other. Now, as in a scientific point of view the relation is the most important thing to know. A knowledge of the one thing leads us a long way towards knowledge of the other." And this philosophy, initially based on mechanical and later on purely mathematical models, would be the key to his remarkable success.

> The concept of the displacement current introduced a role for the theoretical physicist that seems to have been Maxwell's own invention. At the time, theoretical physicists did most of their work producing theories to match observations, but Maxwell saw a role for the theoretician in looking for the holes that were left in experimental evidence and making predictions that could later be tested. The displacement current was not the result of any observation, it was purely a prediction from his model. This apparently small contribution, often overlooked in popular descriptions of Maxwell's work, was revolutionary. There was considerable resistance to this approach from some of his colleagues, but Maxwell's daring step became a central role of theoreticians, to the extent that in some fields this kind of deduction from models came to dominate.
