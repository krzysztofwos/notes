> Another of Shannon's confidants was John von Neumann. It was that word, information, Shannon explained to the great mathematician at one point. He had never liked it. The technical distinction between information and meaning was too much a violation of common usage, he felt, and would just end up confusing people. Could von Neumann suggest anything better? Von Neumann's answer was immediate. As Shannon later recounted the story, you should call it entropy, and for two reasons.
>
> First, von Neumann told the younger man his formula for the information content of a message was mathematically identical to the physicist's formula for entropy, a mathematical variable related to the flow of heat. Shannon was astounded to learn this. He had derived his formulation totally on his own.
>
> But second, and much more important, said von Neumann, most people don't know what entropy really is, and if you use the word entropy in an argument, you will win every time.
>
> In the end, Shannon elected to stick with information, since engineers had been using the word since Hartley's day and weren't about to abandon it.
