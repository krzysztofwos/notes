The experience of craving itself is an experience of dukkha.

[[papañca]] — mental proliferation
nāmarūpa — mentality-materiality; body and mind

Buddha"s formulation of "the five aggregates" (Skt: skandha; Pali: khandha).

1. rūpa – "body," "matter" or "materiality," and also any "form" perceived possessing shape, etc.;
2. vedanā – "sensation," but specifically the "feeling-tone" of sensations, i.e., the quality in any experience of pleasantness, unpleasantness, or neither-pleasantness-nor-unpleasantness;
3. saṃjñā (Skt.), saññā (Pali) – ‘perception’;
4. saṃskārā (Skt.), saṅkhārā (Pali) – "mental formations" or "concoctions," including thoughts, intentions and volitions, and mental factors like attention, etc., which play a part in fabricating experience;
5. vijñāna (Skt.), viññāṇa (Pali) – "consciousness," i.e., any of the six sense-consciousnesses (consciousness of any phenomena of the five senses and of mental phenomena).

All conditioned phenomena, he noted, can be seen to be

1. impermanent ([[anicca]]),
2. unsatisfactory (dukkha),
3. and not-self ([[anattā]]).

We might say that consciousness is perception regarded from the perspective of the knowing—the same coin from its other side.
